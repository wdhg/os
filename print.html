<p>Operating Systems provide a &quot;clean&quot; interface to user applications. This is to abstract the &quot;ugly&quot; interface of the hardware devices, allowing for applications to be more portable as they don't need to be concerned with all possible combinations of hardware.</p>
<h2 id="kernels"><a class="header" href="#kernels">Kernels</a></h2>
<p>Kernels are a part of an OS that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is always loaded in memory.</li>
<li>Executes in a privaleged mode with access to all hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="operating-system-goals"><a class="header" href="#operating-system-goals">Operating System Goals</a></h2>
<h3 id="managing-resources"><a class="header" href="#managing-resources">Managing Resources</a></h3>
<p>An OS must efficiently use it's available resources as they are limited, and it must be capible of sharing its resources among users.</p>
<p>These resources are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processors</strong> (CPU cores, multi-socket CPU, SMT/hyper-threading)</li>
<li><strong>Memory</strong> (caches, RAM, etc)</li>
<li><strong>I/O Devices</strong> (displays, GPUs, network interface cards (NICs), printers, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Internal Devices</strong> (clocks, timers, interrupt controllers, etc)</li>
<li><strong>Non-volatile Storage</strong> (disks, SSDs, DVDs, tapes, etc)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="providing-clean-interfaces"><a class="header" href="#providing-clean-interfaces">Providing Clean Interfaces</a></h3>
<p>An OS must hide the complexity of lower level hardware from higher level systems. This is done by hiding the low level hardware details from programs, and by providing higher level abstractions that user programs can use to request to access to hardware resources.</p>
<h2 id="operating-system-characteristics"><a class="header" href="#operating-system-characteristics">Operating System Characteristics</a></h2>
<h3 id="sharing"><a class="header" href="#sharing">Sharing</a></h3>
<p>An OS must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be able to share data, programs, and hardware. This is done by using time and space multiplexing.</li>
<li>offer resource allocation. It must:
<ul>
<li>ensure efficient and fair usage of memory, CPU time, disk space, etc.</li>
<li>offer mutual exclusion for some resources (unsafe operations must be protected).</li>
<li>protect against corruption of data, whether accidental or malicious.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="concurrency"><a class="header" href="#concurrency">Concurrency</a></h3>
<p>An OS must:</p>
<ul>
<li>support running multiple activities in parallel (I/O and computation, multiple user programs, etc.)</li>
<li>be capible of switching activities at arbitrary moments in time. It must guarantee fairness such that every activity can / will have CPU time, and it must ensure prompt replies to important activities.</li>
<li>guarantee safe concurrency. This includes:
<ul>
<li>offering primitive structures (such as mutexs) to allow for the synchronisation of actions.</li>
<li>protecting from user / process interference. Programs should have their own &quot;space&quot; that no other program can read from / write to accidentally / maliciously.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-determinism"><a class="header" href="#non-determinism">Non-determinism</a></h3>
<p>Events occur in a random and unpredictable order. An OS must be capible of handling this without failure.</p>
<h3 id="storing-data"><a class="header" href="#storing-data">Storing Data</a></h3>
<p>An OS must:</p>
<ul>
<li>offer easy access to files through user-defined names. This is done my managing directory structures, links, and shared disks.</li>
<li>enforce access controls on data, including reading, writing, removing, executing, and copying permissions.</li>
<li>protect against unforseen failures (e.g. by making backups).</li>
<li>manage storage devices by organising disks into volumes, partitions, redundant arrays, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="operating-system-facilities"><a class="header" href="#operating-system-facilities">Operating System Facilities</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplified I/O</strong> (e.g. access to disks, DVDs or remote file servers)</li>
<li><strong>Virtual Memory</strong> (to seperate the user logical memory from physcial memory)</li>
<li><strong>File Systems</strong> (long term storage on disk accessed by names)</li>
<li><strong>Program Interaction and Communication</strong> (e.g. messages, pipes, sockets, shared memory)</li>
<li><strong>Network Communication</strong> (sending / receiving data on a network)</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong> (prevents programs from accessing resources not allocated to them)</li>
<li><strong>Human-computer Interface</strong> (user interaction with programs, command language, shells)</li>
<li><strong>Administration, Management, and Accounting</strong></li>

<h2 id="operating-system-structures"><a class="header" href="#operating-system-structures">Operating System Structures</a></h2>
<h3 id="monolithic-kernels"><a class="header" href="#monolithic-kernels">Monolithic kernels</a></h3>
<p>A single executable with its own address space, acting as a single black box. Their structure is implied through pushing parameters to the stack and trapping to execture system calls. These are the most popular style of kernel.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient calls within kernel.</li>
<li>Easier to write kernel components due to shared memory.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complex design with lots of interactions.</li>
<li>No protection between kernel components. If one part crashes the whole program crashes (less reliable).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="microkernels"><a class="header" href="#microkernels">Microkernels</a></h3>
<p>Small sized kernels that have functionality in user-level servers. They use inter-process communication (IPC) between servers, and have separate servers for device I/O, file access, process scheduling, etc.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernel is less complex so less error-prone.</li>
<li>Servers can have clean interfaces.</li>
<li>If a server crashes, it can be restarted without crashing the entire kernel (more reliable).</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large amount of overhead from IPC within kernel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hybrid-kernels"><a class="header" href="#hybrid-kernels">Hybrid Kernels</a></h3>
<p>Combines features from both monolithic and microkernels. They are a compromise between clean design and performance overhead.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>More structured design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance penalty for user-level servers.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-kernels"><a class="header" href="#example-kernels">Example Kernels</a></h2>
<h3 id="linux-monolithic"><a class="header" href="#linux-monolithic">Linux (monolithic)</a></h3>
<p>Linux system calls are implemented by pushing arguments into registers or the stack and issuing traps to switch from a user context to a kernel one.</p>
<p>Linux supports a rich set of programs (through GNU project). This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>shells (bash, ksh, zsh, etc), compilers, editors, etc.</li>
<li>desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, i3).</li>
<li>Utility programs (file, fitlers, editors, compilers, text processors, sys admin, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Interupt handles are the primary means to interact with devices. They stop the current process, save the current state, starts the driver, then returns to the saved state. They are typically written in assembler as they need to be as fast as possible.</p>
<p>The I/O scheduler orders disk operations.</p>
<p>Linux also supports static in-kernel components and dynamically loadable modules.</p>
<h3 id="windows-hybrid"><a class="header" href="#windows-hybrid">Windows (hybrid)</a></h3>
<p>The Windows NT kernel consists of two layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Executive</strong>: most services.</li>
<li><strong>Kernel</strong>: thread scheduling and synchronisation, traps, interrupt handlers, and CPU management.</li>
</ul>
<p>Programs are built on top of dynamic code libraries (DLLs), and DLLs implement the OS services in a modular fashion.</p>
<p>NTOS provides system calls. It is loaded from ntoskrnl.exe at boot.</p>
<p>Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) abstracts out DMA operations, BIOS config, CPU types.</p>
<p>Device drivers are loaded into kernel memory and are dynamically linked against NTOS and HAL layers.</p>
<h1 id="processes"><a class="header" href="#processes">Processes</a></h1>
<p>A process is an instance of a program being executed (a running program). They allow for a single processor to run multiple programs &quot;simulatneously&quot;. Each process runs on a virtual CPU, and the real CPU can use this to run any single process. Effectively, the single CPU has been divided into multiple virtual CPUs.</p>
<h2 id="why-have-processes"><a class="header" href="#why-have-processes">Why have Processes?</a></h2>
<p>They:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide an illusion of concurrency (more on this later).</li>
<li>provide isolation between programs (each process has its own address space).</li>
<li>simplify programming (programs don't have to worry about other programs).</li>
<li>allow for better utilisation of resources (different processes require different resources at certain times).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="time-slicing-for-concurrency"><a class="header" href="#time-slicing-for-concurrency">Time-Slicing for Concurrency</a></h2>
<p>An OS can switch the current running process every few milliseconds such that every process can have CPU time. This is done using a CPU scheduler, and it can be used to provide pseudo concurrency.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-concurrency"><a class="header" href="#types-of-concurrency">Types of Concurrency</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pseudo Concurrency</strong>: a single processor switches between processes by interleaving their runtimes. Overtime this can give the illusion of concurrent execution.</li>
<li><strong>Real Concurrency</strong>: multiple processors or CPU cores are used to run multiple processes in parallel.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fairness"><a class="header" href="#fairness">Fairness</a></h2>
<p>Fairness is the concept that the CPU scheduler switches fairly between processes. This means that every process should have equal CPU time, or more generally they should have appropriate CPU times determined by each processes priority and workload.</p>
<h2 id="context-switches"><a class="header" href="#context-switches">Context Switches</a></h2>
<p>A context switch is when a processor switches from executing one process to another.</p>
<p>An OS may switch either periodically or in reponse to certain events / interrupts (such as I/O completion). Context switches are not pre-determined because the events causing them are non-deterministic.</p>
<p>Since processes will need to be restarted safely when being switched to, all relevant information (e.g. register values) must be stored when they are switched away from. This is done by storing the data in a process descriptor or a process control block (PCB), which is kept inside a process table.</p>
<p>Context switches are expensive. The process state needs to be saved / restored and CPU caches (including translation lookaside buffer (TLB)) will be lost. It is important for an OS to avoid unnecessary context switches.</p>
<h2 id="process-control-block-pcb"><a class="header" href="#process-control-block-pcb">Process Control Block (PCB)</a></h2>
<p>Each process has it's own virtual machine: They have their own virtual CPU, address space (stack, heap, text, data, etc), open file descriptors, etc. Enough data must be stored such that all of this remains preserved after a context switch.</p>
<p>The information that gets stored on a context switch is:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Registers</strong>: program counter (PC), page table register, stack pointer, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Process management info</strong>: process ID (PID), parent process, process group, priority, CPU used, etc.</li>
<li><strong>File management info</strong>: root directory, working directory, open file descriptors, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process-creation"><a class="header" href="#process-creation">Process Creation</a></h2>
<p>There are two types of processes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foreground</strong>: processes that interact with users.</li>
<li><strong>Background</strong>: daemons (e.g. handling incoming mail, printing requests, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Processes are created on:</p>
<ul>
<li>system initialisation.</li>
<li>user request.</li>
<li>system calls by a running process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Processes terminated can be caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Normal Completion</strong>: when the process completes the execution of its body.</li>
<li><strong>System Calls</strong>: e.g. <code>exit()</code> in UNIX, <code>ExitProcess()</code> in Windows.</li>
<li><strong>Abnormal Exit</strong>: when the process runs into an error or unhandled exception.</li>
<li><strong>Aborted</strong>: when another process overrules its execution (e.g. killed from terminall).</li>
<li><strong>Never</strong>: some processes run in an endless loop and never terminate unless an error occurs (e.g. most web servers).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="process-hierarchies"><a class="header" href="#process-hierarchies">Process Hierarchies</a></h2>
<p>UNIX allows for processes to form hierarchies (e.g. parent, child, child's child, etc).</p>
<p>Windows has no notion of process hierarchy. Instead when a process is created its parent is given a handle token to control it. This handle can be passed around to other processes.</p>

<li>Events, Exceptions (Windows).</li>
<li>Pipes.</li>
<li>Message Queues (UNIX).</li>
<li>Mailslots (Windows).</li>

<li>Shared memory.</li>
<li>Semaphores.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter will focus on UNIX process communication.</p>
<h2 id="unix-signals"><a class="header" href="#unix-signals">UNIX Signals</a></h2>
<p>Signals are a Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism. They are used to notify a process when an event has occured. Signal delivery is similar to the delivery of hardware interrupts.</p>
<p>A proceess can only send signals to another process if it has the correct permissions to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>The real or effective user ID of the receiving process must match that of the sending process, or the user must have the appropriate privileges.</li>
<li>The kernel can send signals to any process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Signals are generated:</p>
<ul>
<li>when an exeception occurs (e.g. division by zero = <code>SIGFPE</code>, segment violation = <code>SIGSEGV</code>).</li>
<li>when the kernel wants to notify the process of an event that has occured (e.g. if the process writes to a closed pipe = <code>SIGPIPE</code>).</li>
<li>when the user enters certain key combinations (e.g. CTRL+C = <code>SIGINT</code>).</li>
<li>when using the <code>kill</code> system call.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the UNIX signals are as follows (from <code>man signal</code>):</p>
<ol>
<li><code>SIGHUP</code>:     terminal line hangup</li>
<li><code>SIGINT</code>:     interrupt program</li>
<li><code>SIGQUIT</code>:    quit program</li>
<li><code>SIGILL</code>:     illegal instruction</li>
<li><code>SIGTRAP</code>:    trace trap</li>
<li><code>SIGABRT</code>:    abort program (formerly SIGIOT)</li>
<li><code>SIGEMT</code>:     emulate instruction executed</li>
<li><code>SIGFPE</code>:     floating-point exception</li>
<li><code>SIGKILL</code>:    kill program</li>
<li><code>SIGBUS</code>:     bus error</li>
<li><code>SIGSEGV</code>:    segmentation violation</li>
<li><code>SIGSYS</code>:     non-existent system call invoked</li>
<li><code>SIGPIPE</code>:    write on a pipe with no reader</li>
<li><code>SIGALRM</code>:    real-time timer expired</li>
<li><code>SIGTERM</code>:    software termination signal</li>
<li><code>SIGURG</code>:     urgent condition present on socket</li>
<li><code>SIGSTOP</code>:    stop (cannot be caught or ignored)</li>
<li><code>SIGTSTP</code>:    stop signal generated from keyboard</li>
<li><code>SIGCONT</code>:    continue after stop</li>
<li><code>SIGCHLD</code>:    child status has changed</li>
<li><code>SIGTTIN</code>:    background read attempted from control terminal</li>
<li><code>SIGTTOU</code>:    background write attempted to control terminal</li>
<li><code>SIGIO</code>:      I/O is possible on a descriptor (see fcntl(2))</li>
<li><code>SIGXCPU</code>:    cpu time limit exceeded (see setrlimit(2))</li>
<li><code>SIGXFSZ</code>:    file size limit exceeded (see setrlimit(2))</li>
<li><code>SIGVTALRM</code>:  virtual time alarm (see setitimer(2))</li>
<li><code>SIGPROF</code>:    profiling timer alarm (see setitimer(2))</li>
<li><code>SIGWINCH</code>:   Window size change</li>
<li><code>SIGINFO</code>:    status request from keyboard</li>
<li><code>SIGUSR1</code>:    User defined signal 1</li>
<li><code>SIGUSR2</code>:    User defined signal 2</li>
</ol>
<p>The default action for most signals is to terminal the process, however the receiving process can choose to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ignore the signal.</li>
<li>handle the signal by installing a signal handler.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two exceptions are <code>SIGKILL</code> and <code>SIGSTOP</code>, which cannot be ignored or handled.</p>
<p>An example signal handler is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;signal.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void sigint_handler(int sig) {
  fprintf(stderr, &quot; =&gt; SIGINT caught!\n&quot;);

<h2 id="unix-pipes"><a class="header" href="#unix-pipes">UNIX Pipes</a></h2>
<p>A pipe connects the standard output of one process to the standard input of another process. This allows for a one-way communication channel between processes.</p>
<p>They are extremely useful in the command line / shell scripts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">ls | less
ps aux | grep my_prog.out
</code></pre>
<p>There exist two types of pipes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unnamed</strong>: created, used, and destroyed within the life of the process.</li>
<li><strong>Named (FIFOs)</strong>: persistent pipes that can outlive the process that created them. They are stored on the file system, and any process can open it like a regular file. They are more efficient than using files as they only exist in memory.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unnamed-pipes"><a class="header" href="#unnamed-pipes">Unnamed Pipes</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-c">int pipe(int fd[2])

<p><code>pipe</code> returns two file descriptors:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fd[0]</code>: the read end of the pipe (sender should close).</li>
<li><code>fd[1]</code>: the write end of the pipe (receiver should close).</li>
</ul>
<p>If a receiver reads from an empty pipe, it blocks until data is written at the other end. If the sender writes to a full pipe, it blocks until the data is read at the other end and the pipe is cleared.</p>
<p>An example of <code>pipe</code> is:</p>

<h1 id="threads"><a class="header" href="#threads">Threads</a></h1>
<p>A thread is an execution stream that share the same address space. When multithreading is used, each process can contain one or more threads.</p>
<p>A break down of per process and per thread items is:</p>
<p>Per process items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Address space.</li>
<li>Global variables.</li>
<li>Open files.</li>
<li>Child processes.</li>
<li>Signals.</li>

<h2 id="why-threads"><a class="header" href="#why-threads">Why Threads?</a></h2>
<p>Many applications require running multiple activities, some of which need to:</p>

<li>access and process the same data.</li>
<li>potentially block.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-not-processes"><a class="header" href="#why-not-processes">Why not Processes?</a></h2>
<p>Threads are much lighter than processes. Processes have a lot more state associated with them (e.g. their own address spaces and other kernel state). They also:</p>
<ul>
<li>are difficult to communitcate between as they have different address spaces.</li>
<li>may block, causing the entire application to be switched out.</li>
<li>require expensive context switches as we need to change the address space that is currently visible to the executing program.</li>
<li>are expensive to create / destroy.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problems--concerns-with-threads"><a class="header" href="#problems--concerns-with-threads">Problems / Concerns with Threads</a></h2>
<p>Threads have a shared address space. This means that they don't have any protection from reading / writing to each others stack like processes have. This can cause memory corruption issues and other concurrency bugs due to concurrent access to shared data (e.g. through global variables).</p>
<p>Forking inside a thread is another concern. Does the fork create a new process with the same number of threads, or with a single thread?</p>
<p>Handling signals also becomes an issue. Which thread should handle the signal?</p>

<p>From the perspective of the Kernel, it is managing processes only. Threads are implemented by a software library, and the process maintains its own thread table for scheduling.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better performance as:

<li>Thread creation and termination are fast.</li>
<li>Thread switching is fast.</li>
<li>Thread synchronisation (e.g. via joining other threads) is fast.</li>

<h2 id="kernel-threads"><a class="header" href="#kernel-threads">Kernel Threads</a></h2>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blocking system calls / page faults is easy, as if one thread blocks / causes a page fault the kernel can schedule a runnable thread from the same process</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thread creation and termination is more expensive as they require systems calls (still much cheaper than processes), but this can be mitigated by recycling threads using thread pools.</li>
<li>Thread synchronisation becomes more expensive as they require blocking system calls.</li>
<li>Thread switching becomes more expensive as they require a system call (again, still much cheaper than process switches as they all exist in the same address space).</li>

<p>States are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New</strong>: the process is being created.</li>
<li><strong>Ready</strong>: the process is runnable and awaiting for processor time.</li>

<p>When multiple processes are ready to be run, something needs to decide which one to run. This is the purpose of the <strong>scheduler</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="goals-of-scheduling-alorithms"><a class="header" href="#goals-of-scheduling-alorithms">Goals of Scheduling Alorithms</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure Fairness</strong>: comparable processes should get comparable services.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid Indefinite Postponement</strong>: no process should starve (i.e. every process should get CPU time).</li>
<li><strong>Enforce Policy</strong>: e.g. process priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Maximize Resource Utilisation</strong>: e.g. CPU, I/O devices, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize Overhead</strong>: minimize context switches, scheduling decisions should be fast and lightweight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Certain systems have even more goals depending on their workload:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Batch Systems</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Throughput: number of jobs per unit of time.</li>
<li>Turnaround time: time between job submission and completion</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Interactive Systems</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Response Time (crucial): time between request being issued and first response.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Systems</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Soft Deadlines: failure to meet deadline is at most an annoyance (e.g. leading to degraded video quality).</li>
<li>Hard Deadlines: failure to meet deadline is severe (e.g. leading to a plane crash).</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling"><a class="header" href="#preemptive-vs-non-preemptive-scheduling">Preemptive vs Non-Preemptive Scheduling</a></h2>
<p><strong>Preemptive</strong> scheduling only allows processes to run for a maximum amount of fixed time. This requires a clock interrupt.</p>

<h2 id="cpu-bound-vs-io-bound-processes"><a class="header" href="#cpu-bound-vs-io-bound-processes">CPU-Bound vs I/O-Bound Processes</a></h2>

<h2 id="general-purpose-scheduling"><a class="header" href="#general-purpose-scheduling">General-Purpose Scheduling</a></h2>
<p>A general-purpose scheduler for an OS should use an algorithm that:</p>

<p><strong>Scheduling algorithms often need to balance conflicting goals</strong>. This is to ensure fairness, enforce policy, maximise resource utilisation, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Different scheduling algorithms are appropriate in different contexts</strong>. A batch system will require a very different scheduling algorithm compared to an interactive system or real-time system.</p>

<h1 id="first-come-first-served-fcfs-non-preemptive"><a class="header" href="#first-come-first-served-fcfs-non-preemptive">First-Come First-Served (FCFS) (Non-Preemptive)</a></h1>
<p><img src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neetu_Goel4/publication/249645533/figure/download/fig1/AS:668501794643974@1536394656707/First-Come-First-Serve-Scheduling-Characteristics-The-lack-of-prioritization-does.png" alt="FCFS Diagram" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/First-Come-First-Serve-Scheduling-Characteristics-The-lack-of-prioritization-does_fig1_249645533">Source</a></p>
<p>In FCFS, new processes (and waiting processes once their event arrives) get added to the end of a ready queue. The scheduler takes the first process off the queue and runs it, and either the process gets terminated or added back to the waiting processes list (non-preemptive).</p>
<p>Advantages of FCFS:</p>
<ul>
<li>No indefinite postponement as all processes will eventually be scheduled.</li>
<li>Extreamly simple to implement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of FCFS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Long processes prevent shorter processes from completing, potentially reducing the overall throughput and / or turnaround time.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="round-robin-rr-preemptive"><a class="header" href="#round-robin-rr-preemptive">Round-Robin (RR) (Preemptive)</a></h1>
<p>RR is like FCFS, except the scheduler can preemptively stop the current process and put it back on the end of the ready queue when its time quantum is exceeded.</p>
<p><strong>Time quantum</strong> is the allotted amount of processor time each process receives upon entering the running state. Quantum (also known as time slice) is usually around 10-200ms.</p>
<p>Advantages of RR:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is fair as every ready job gets an equal share of the CPU.</li>
<li>Response time is fast for a small number of jobs.</li>
<li>The average turnaround time is low when run-times differ.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of RR:</p>
<ul>
<li>Response time is high for large numbers of jobs as the entire ready queue will be long.</li>
<li>If run-times are similar, turnaround time is high.</li>
</ul>
<p>RR Overhead is calculated as the time taken to switch contexts divided by the quantum value. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>4ms quantum with 1ms context switch time = 1/4 = 20% of time (high overhead).</li>
<li>1s quantum with 1ms context switch time = 1/1000 = 0.1% of time (low overhead).</li>
</ul>
<p>In general, as quantum increases:</p>
<ul>
<li>overhead decreases.</li>
<li>response time worsens (e.g. when quantum = ∞, RR becomes FCFS).</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, when choosing a quantum value it should be much larger than than the context switch cost, but also provide a decent response time (depending on the expected workload).</p>
<p>Some example quantum values for standard processes (although values can vary depending on process type, behaviour, priority, etc):</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: 100ms.</li>
<li>Windows client: 20ms.</li>
<li>Windows server: 180ms.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="shortest-job-first-sjf-non-preemptive-and-shortest-remaining-time-srt-preemptive"><a class="header" href="#shortest-job-first-sjf-non-preemptive-and-shortest-remaining-time-srt-preemptive">Shortest Job First (SJF) (Non-Preemptive) and Shortest Remaining Time (SRT) (Preemptive)</a></h1>
<p>SJF performs scheduling by using the run-times that are known in advance, and simply picks the shortest job first. This can provide better turnaround time when compared with FCFS, and it is provably optimal when all jobs are available simulatneously.</p>
<p>SRT is the preemptive version of SJF. It also requires that runtimes are known in advance. It chooses the process whose remaining time is shortest.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>There exist 2 jobs in the ready queue, j1 = 6s and j2 = 4s.</li>
<li>After 2 seconds, a new job of 1s arrives.</li>
<li>In SJF, the job execution order looks like:
<ol>
<li>j2 for 4s.</li>
<li>j3 for 1s.</li>
<li>j1 for 6s.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>In SRT, the job execution order looks like:
<ol>
<li>j2 for 2s.</li>
<li>j3 for 1s.</li>
<li>j2 for 2s more.</li>
<li>j1 for 6s.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="note-knowing-run-times-in-advance"><a class="header" href="#note-knowing-run-times-in-advance">Note: Knowing Run-Times in Advance</a></h2>
<p>Typically, run-times aren't usually available or even calculatable in advance. However, they can be estimated by either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Computing CPU burst estimates on heuristics (e.g. based on previous execution history). However, this is not always applicable.</li>
<li>The user provides estimates for their process. In some cases, a user may attempt to cheat the system by under estimating their run-time, and so the scheduler needs to be able to counteract this (e.g. terminating or penalising processes after they exceed their estimated run-time).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="fair-share-scheduling"><a class="header" href="#fair-share-scheduling">Fair-Share Scheduling</a></h1>
<p>In fair-share, users are assigned some fraction of the CPU and the scheduler takes into account who owns a process before scheduling it. Fair-share is usually implemented along side other scheduling algorithms, most commonly round-robin.</p>
<p>For example, assume there are two users each with 50% share of the CPU:</p>
<ul>
<li>User 1 has 4 processes: <code>A, B, C, D</code>.</li>
<li>User 2 has 2 processes: <code>E, F</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Under a fair-share round-robin scheduler, a potential execution order of these processes could be <code>A, E, B, F, C, E, D, F</code>.</p>
<h1 id="priority-scheduling-preemptive"><a class="header" href="#priority-scheduling-preemptive">Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)</a></h1>
<p>Under a priority scheduling algorithm, processes are assigned priorities. Priorities are a heuristic used to determine the importance of the workload of the process. The result is that more important workloads (e.g. user facing processes such as video games) can be executed before lower priority ones (e.g. background processes fetching data like the weather).</p>
<p>Priorities can be externally provided (e.g. from the user), or they can be based on process-specific metrics (e.g. their expected CPU burst). Priorities can also be <strong>static</strong> (i.e. unchanging) or <strong>dynamic</strong> (i.e. changing).</p>
<p>For example, assume there exist 3 processes that arrive at the same time:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code>: Priority = 4</li>
<li><code>B</code>: Priority = 7</li>
<li><code>C</code>: Priority = 1</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, higher priority values means higher priority (in practice it can be the other way round). Under these conditions, the processes would execute in the order of <code>B, A, C</code>.</p>
<h1 id="multilevel-feedback-queues-mlfqs-preemptive"><a class="header" href="#multilevel-feedback-queues-mlfqs-preemptive">Multilevel Feedback Queues (MLFQS) (Preemptive)</a></h1>
<p>MLFQS is a practical way of implementing a priority based scheduling scheme. It is rather basic and fairly common, used in many OSs such as: Windows Vista, Windows 7, Mac OS X, Linux 2.6-2.6.23.</p>
<p>It works by having one queue for each possible priority level. The scheduler simply runs the job on the highest non-empty priority queue, and each queue can use a different scheduling algorithm (round-robin is typically used).</p>
<p>MLFQS needs:</p>
<ul>
<li>to determine the current nature of the job (e.g. is it I/O bound or CPU-bound?).</li>
<li>to worry about starvation of lower-priority jobs.</li>
<li>a feedback mechanism where job priorities are recomputed periodically (e.g. based on how much CPU they have recently used) and processes undergo <strong>aging</strong> where their priority increases as they waits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some issues with MLFQS are that:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It is not very flexible</strong>: applications have effectively no control and priorities make no guarantees.</li>
<li><strong>Does not react quickly to changes</strong>: it often requires a warm-up period (i.e. running the system for a while to get better results), which is a problem for real-time systems, multimedia apps, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Cheating is a concern</strong>: a process can add meaningless I/O to boost its priority.</li>
<li><strong>Cannot donate priority</strong>: a high priority process that requrie resources held by a low priority process must wait for the algorithm to increase the low priority process's priority before it can continue.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="lottery-scheduling-preemptive"><a class="header" href="#lottery-scheduling-preemptive">Lottery Scheduling (Preemptive)</a></h1>
<p>In lottery scheduling, jobs receive lottery tickets for various resources (e.g. CPU time), and at each scheduling decision, one ticket is chosen at random. The job holding that ticket wins, and receives what ever resource it was waiting for.</p>
<p>For example, in a system with 100 tickets for CPU time if process A has 20 tickets, it's probabilty of running during the CPU quantum is 20%. Over a long period of time, this should end up resulting in A having 20% of the overall CPU time.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The number of lottery tickets is meaningful</strong>: jobs holding p% of tickets should get p% of resources (unlike priorities).</li>
<li><strong>It is highly responsive</strong>: if a new job is given p% of tickets it has p% chance to get what ever resource it requires at the <strong>next</strong> scheduling decision.</li>
<li><strong>There is no starvation</strong>: every job will always have a chance of being run.</li>
<li><strong>Jobs can exchange tickets</strong>: allowing for priority donation and for cooperating jobs to acheive certain goals.</li>
<li><strong>Adding / removing jobs affect the remaining jobs proportionally</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Response time becomes unpredictable</strong>: it is not impossible for a process to be unlucky for a few lotteries, which can be bad for real time applications / interactive processes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="synchronisation"><a class="header" href="#synchronisation">Synchronisation</a></h1>

<li>Deadlocks.</li>
<li>Starvation.</li>
<li>Synchronisation Mechanism (e.g. locks, semaphores, monitors, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>These concepts are relevant to <strong>both</strong> processes and threads, but to keep things simple they will both be refered to as processes throughout this chapter unless stated otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="critical-sections-and-mutual-exclusion"><a class="header" href="#critical-sections-and-mutual-exclusion">Critical Sections and Mutual Exclusion</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>critical section / region</strong> is a section of code in which processes access a shared resource.</p>
<p><strong>Mutual exclusion</strong> ensure that if one process is executing a critical section, no other process can be executing it (processes must request permission to enter critical sections).</p>
<p>A <strong>synchronisation mechanism</strong> is used at the entry / exit of a critical section, and is what processes use to request permission to enter it.</p>
<p>The requirements for mutual exclusion are:</p>
<ul>
<li>no two processes may be simulatneously inside the same critical section.</li>
<li>no process running outside the critical section may prevent other processes from entering the critical section. This means when no process is currently inside a critical section, any process that requests permission to enter must be allowed to do so immeditately.</li>
<li>no process requiring access to its critical section can be delayed forever (i.e. all processes requesting entry must be granted it at some point).</li>
<li>no assumptions are to be made about the relative speed of processes i.e a process cannot assume that another process will exit its critical section in a given amount of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>By using <code>CLI</code> and <code>STI</code> to disable / enable interrupts, mutual exclusion can be achieved as other processes won't be able to be scheduled:</p>

void safe_set_value(int index, int value) {

<p>There are a few issues with this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>it only works on single-processor systems. Other processes on other processors will still be running.</li>
<li>misbehaving / buggy processes may not release the CPU.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, disabling interrupts should only used by kernel code that requires the fine level of control / performance, and it should be used as little as possible in the kernel code as well.</p>
<h2 id="strict-alternation"><a class="header" href="#strict-alternation">Strict Alternation</a></h2>
<p>Strict alternation relies on a variable, say <code>turn</code>, to control which process can run at any moment in time. At the end of its critical section, a process will update the <code>turn</code> variable to indicate it is done.</p>
<p>For example, assume there are two processes A and B which have an overlapping critical section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// ...

char turn = 'A';

void process_work_a() {
  while (true) {
    while (turn != 'A') {}    // empty loop to await turn
    critical_section();       // enter critical_section
    turn = 'B';               // leave critical_section
    non_critical_section_a(); // non-critical section
  }
}

void process_work_b()(void *arg) {
  while (true) {
    while (turn != 'B') {}
    critical_section();
    turn = 'A';
    non_critical_section_b();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This fixes the problem of having to turn off interrupts, but it also introduces new problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it is process A's turn, but it is in its non-critical section, it can take as long as it wants / never enter its critical section again. B will be stuck waiting for A, which breaks two rules:
<ul>
<li>that no process should be able to prevent another process from entering its critical section</li>
<li>that if no process is in its critical section, and process attempting to enter its critical section should be allowed to do so immeditately.</li>
<li>depending on the behaviour of <code>non_critical_section_a</code>, it could potentially break a third rule: that no process should be waiting to enter its critical section forever.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>process B is unable to enter its critical section twice in a row as it is forced to wait for process A to update <code>turn</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="busy-waiting"><a class="header" href="#busy-waiting">Busy Waiting</a></h3>
<p>Strict alternation uses a mechanism called <strong>busy waiting</strong>, which means a loop that constantly tests a value until it meets a certain condition. This is bad as it wastes valuable CPU time. As a result, busy waiting should only ever be used when the wait is expected to be short.</p>
<h2 id="petersons-solution--algorithm"><a class="header" href="#petersons-solution--algorithm">Peterson's Solution / Algorithm</a></h2>
<p>Peterson's solution is similar to strict alternation, but it solves a few of its issues.</p>
<p>An example of it is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;

int turn = 0;
bool interested[2] = {false, false};

// thead is either 0 or 1
void enter_critical(int thread) {
  int other_thread = 1 - thread;
  interested[thread] = true;
  turn = other_thread;
  while (turn == other_thread &amp;&amp; interested[other_thread]) {}
}

void exit_critical(int thread) {
  interested[thread] = 0;
}

// ...

void process_work_0() {
  enter_critical(0);
  critical_section();
  exit_critical(0);
}

void process_work_1() {
  enter_critical(1);
  critical_section();
  exit_critical(1);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Using this example, here is a proof of the mutual exclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assume processes 0 and 1 are requesting permission to enter the critical section. Then <code>interested[0] = true</code>, <code>interested[1] = true</code>, and <code>turn</code> is controlling which thread is able to enter the critical section.</li>
<li>If <code>turn = 0</code>, process 0 will then be able to enter into the critical section. Process 1 is now waiting for process 0 to set <code>interested[0]</code> to <code>false</code>, which only happens when process 0 calls <code>exit_critical</code>. Once process 0 has called <code>exit_critical</code>, then process 1 is allowed to enter the critical section.</li>
<li>If <code>turn = 1</code> the opposite will happen, where process 1 will enter the critical section before process 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>One major downside to Peterson's solution is that it still uses busy waiting.</p>
<h1 id="atomic-operations"><a class="header" href="#atomic-operations">Atomic Operations</a></h1>
<p>An <strong>atomic operation</strong> is a sequence of one of more statements that is / appears to be indivisible i.e. they will always be executed without any potential for interrupts in the middle of execution.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>: not every single statement is atomic. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void withdraw(int account_no, int amount) {
  int balance = accounts[account_no];
  accounts[account_no] = balance - amount;
}
</code></pre>
<p>could be rewritten as:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void withdraw(int account_no, int amount) {
  accounts[account_no] -= amount;
}
</code></pre>
<p>but it would <strong>not</strong> be atomic as <code>-=</code> is simply syntactic sugar for what was written before.</p>
<h1 id="locks--mutexes"><a class="header" href="#locks--mutexes">Locks / Mutexes</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>lock</strong> (also known as <strong>mutex</strong>) is a piece of data that restricts access to a certain resource. A process can:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;acquire&quot; a lock, preventing any other process from accessing the data associated with the lock.</li>
<li>&quot;release&quot; it, allowing the next process to acquire it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Locks are purely symbolic as nothing forces a process to acquire a lock before accessing the protected data.</p>
<p>An example of how we would use these locks would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">int *accounts;
lock_t accounts_lock; // a lock of some type lock_t

void withdraw(int account_no, int amount) {
  acquire(accounts_lock);

  int balance = accounts[account_no];
  accounts[account_no] = balance - amount;

  release(accounts_lock);
}
</code></pre>
<p>One attempt at implementing <code>acquire</code> and <code>release</code> is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// here lock_t is replaces with *int

void acquire(*int lock) {
  while (*lock != 0) {}
  *lock = 1;
}

void release(*int lock) {
  *lock = 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>but this has the issue that the two instructions in <code>acquire</code> (the <code>while</code> loop and the assignment) are <strong>not</strong> atomic. This means that two or more processes could read at the same time that a lock is free and attempt to acquire it.</p>
<p>How this is resolved is in the hardware of the CPU. A test-and-set instruction is provided, which can atomically test the value of lock and can set it if it is released. Most CPUs have this instruction.</p>
<p>Revisiting the previous example, <code>acquire</code> can be reimplemented using a new function called <code>TSL</code>, whichs returns <code>1</code> if it acquires the lock, and <code>0</code> otherwise:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">void acquire(*int lock) {
  while (TSL(lock) != 0) {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>This implementation is known as a <strong>spin lock</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="spin-locks"><a class="header" href="#spin-locks">Spin Locks</a></h2>
<p>Spin locks are locks that use busy waiting whilst waiting for the lock to release. They:</p>
<ul>
<li>waste CPU time from busy waiting, but are useful then the wait is expected to be short as they can be faster than alternative implementations (more on this later).</li>
<li>may run into the priority inversion problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="priority-inversion-problem"><a class="header" href="#priority-inversion-problem">Priority Inversion Problem</a></h2>
<p>The priority inversion problem is a scenario where a high priority process is indirectly preempted by a lower priority process.</p>
<p>For example, assume there are two processes H and L with high and low priorities respectively. Under normal conditions, H should be scheduled if it is runnable. However, consider the following scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>H is blocked whilst waiting for I/O.</li>
<li>L, during this time, acquires lock A.</li>
<li>H is unblocked and is scheduled.</li>
<li>H attempts to acquire lock A.</li>
</ol>
<p>If A is a spin lock, then H would still be scheduled as it is busy waiting and has a higher priority than L. L would never get scheduled, effectively preventing both H and L from continuing.</p>
<p>Two solutions to this problem is to either not use spin locks, or to temporarily increase L's priority whilst it holds lock A.</p>
<h2 id="lock-granularity"><a class="header" href="#lock-granularity">Lock Granularity</a></h2>
<p><strong>Lock granularity</strong> is the amount of data a lock is protecting. Lock granularity is described as either course or fine:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course-grained</strong>: a large amount of data is protected by the lock.</li>
<li><strong>Fine-grained</strong>: a small amount of data is protected by the lock.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lock overhead</strong> is a measure of cost associated with using locks (e.g. memory space, initialisation, acquire and release times).</p>
<p><strong>Lock contention</strong> is a measure of the number of processes waiting for a lock. Typically as contention increases, parallelism decreases.</p>
<p>An example of course-grained locking is:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// ...

<p>Different level granularity solutions have their uses, but typically as granularity gets finer:</p>
<ul>
<li>lock overhead increase due to there being more locks.</li>
<li>lock contention decreases as its less likely that processes will contend for the same lock.</li>
<li>complexity increases as lock acquisition order and storing the locks safely needs to be considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>To minimise lock contention and maximise concurrency:</p>
<ul>
<li>choose a finer lock granularity (but understand its tradeoffs)</li>
<li>release a lock as soon as possible (make critical sections as <strong>small</strong> as possible)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="read--write-locks-rw-locks"><a class="header" href="#read--write-locks-rw-locks">Read / Write Locks (RW Locks)</a></h2>
<p>If multiple processes are simply reading the same data, then a lock may not even be required. However, if a process begins to write to this data, then a lock is required.</p>
<p>The solution to this are read / write locks (also known as reader-writer locks). RW locks allow for concurrent read-only access, or exclusive read and write access.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">// ...

int *accounts;
rwlock_t accounts_lock; // for some rwlock_t type

void get_balance(int account_no) {
  aquire_read(accounts_lock);
  int balance = accounts[account_no];
  release(accounts_lock);
  return balance;
}

void withdraw(int account_no, int amount) {
  acquire_write(accounts_lock);
  accounts[account_no] -= amount;
  release(accounts_lock);
}

void process_work_a() {
  int balance = get_balance(1);
  // ...
}

void process_work_b() {
  int balance = get_balance(2);
  // ...
}

void process_work_c() {
  withdraw(2, 40);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Processes A and B can safely execute at the same time. However, as soon as process C acquires the lock in write mode, processes A and B will be blocked until C completes it's workload.</p>

<h3 id="happens-before-relationship"><a class="header" href="#happens-before-relationship">Happens-Before Relationship</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>happens-before relationship</strong> is a theoretical framework that is used reason about race conditions under concurrency. It works by introducing a partial order between events (e.g. instructions) in a trace, denoted by <code>a -&gt; b</code> where <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are events in a trace.</p>
<p>For example, consider <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> where <code>a</code> occurs before <code>b</code> in the trace:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are in the same thread, then <code>a -&gt; b</code>.</li>
<li>If <code>a</code> is <code>release(lock)</code> and <code>b</code> is <code>acquire(lock)</code>, then <code>a -&gt; b</code> (this can be generalised for other synchronisation mechanisms).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some properties about <code>-&gt;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Irreflexive</strong>: for all <code>a</code>, <code>a -/-&gt; a</code> (i.e. <code>a -&gt; a</code> is impossible).</li>
<li><strong>Antisymmetric</strong>: for all <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, if <code>a -&gt; b</code> then <code>b -/-&gt; a</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Transitive</strong>: for all <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>c</code>, if <code>a -&gt; b</code> and <code>b -&gt; c</code> then <code>a -&gt; c</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A data race (race condition) occurs between <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in the trace if and only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>they access the same memory location.</li>
<li>at least one of the is a write.</li>
<li>they are unordered accoring to happens-before.</li>

<p>The partial orders are: <code>a = 1 -&gt; b = 1</code> and <code>b = 2 -&gt; a = 2</code>. Since the instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>access the same memory</li>
<li>are all writes</li>
<li>are unordered accoring to happens-before</li>
</ul>
<p>there is an obvious data race.</p>

<p>The potential traces are: </p>
<ul>
<li><code>acquire(a_b_lock) -&gt; a = 1 -&gt; b = 1 -&gt; release(a_b_lock) -&gt; acquire(a_b_lock) -&gt; b = 2 -&gt; a = 2 -&gt; release(a_b_lock)</code></li>

  acquire(b_lock); // lock
  b++;             // write
  release(b_lock); // unlock
  a++;             // write
}
</code></pre>
<p>This example is interesting. If we assume thread A is scheduled first, the trace would look like:</p>
<p><code>a++ -&gt; acquire(b_lock) -&gt; b++ -&gt; release(b_lock) -&gt; acquire(b_lock) -&gt; b++ -&gt; release(b_lock) -&gt; a++</code></p>
<p>which looks safe. However, if thread B is scheduled first the trace would look like:</p>
<pre><code>acquire(b_lock) -&gt; b++ -&gt; release(b_lock) -&gt; a++
                                |

                   a++ -&gt; acquire(b_lock) -&gt; b++ -&gt; release(b_lock)

<h1 id="semaphores"><a class="header" href="#semaphores">Semaphores</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>semaphore</strong> is a structure which allows a process to stop and wait for a signal, and continue once it receives this signal. </p>
<p>Semaphores are accessible using the following <strong>atomic</strong> operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>init(s, i)</code> initialise a semaphore <code>s</code> with value <code>i</code>.</li>
<li><code>down(s)</code> (also known as <code>P()</code>): wait to receive a signal through semaphore <code>s</code>.</li>
<li><code>up(s)</code> (also known as <code>V()</code>): transmit a signal through semaphore <code>s</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="semaphore-internals--implementation"><a class="header" href="#semaphore-internals--implementation">Semaphore Internals / Implementation</a></h2>
<p>A semaphore consists of two private pieces of data:</p>

<h1 id="monitors"><a class="header" href="#monitors">Monitors</a></h1>
<p>A <strong>monitor</strong> is a higher-level synchronisation primitive that allows threads to have both mutual exclusion and the ability to await a signal / condition to become true or false.</p>
<p>A monitor consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>shared data.</li>
<li>entry procedures (must be called to <strong>enter the monitor</strong>).</li>
<li>internal procedures (can only be called by a process <strong>inside the monitor</strong>).</li>
<li>an (implicit) monitor lock.</li>
<li>one or more condition variables.</li>
</ul>
<p>A process being <strong>inside the monitor</strong> means that it has mutual exclusion over all of the shared data. Processes can call an entry procedure to enter the monitor and gain access to the internal data / procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Only one process can be inside the monitor at any given time</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="condition-variables"><a class="header" href="#condition-variables">Condition Variables</a></h2>
<p>A condition variable is associated with some high-level condition, for example (in the context of producers / consumers):</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;some space has become available in the buffer&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;some data has arrived in the buffer&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p>A condition variable has the following operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wait(c)</code>: releases the monitor lock and waits for the condition variable <code>c</code> to be signalled.</li>
<li><code>signal(c)</code>: wakes up one process waiting for <code>c</code> to be signalled.</li>
<li><code>broadcast(c)</code>: wakes up all processes waiting for <code>c</code> to be signalled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Signals on a condition variable do not accumulate. If a condition variable is signalled but no process is waiting for it, the signal is lost.</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-on-a-signal"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-on-a-signal">What Happens on a Signal?</a></h3>
<p>There are two different implementations of what to do on a signal, one defined by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare">Hoare</a> and the other by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Lampson">Lampson</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hoare</strong>: A process waiting for a signal is immeditately scheduled.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to reason about.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inefficient. The process which sends the signal is switched out even if it has not finished with the monitor.</li>
<li>It places extra constraints on the scheduler as it is harder to implement.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lampson</strong>: Sending a signal and waking up from a wait is not atomic.</p>
<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>More efficient as there are no constraints on the scheduler.</li>
<li>More tolerant of errors: if the condition being signalled is wrong, it is simply discarded when rechecked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>More difficult to understand as <code>wait</code> and <code>signal</code> are no longer atomic, so the programmer must be careful when waking up from a <code>wait</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, Lampson's implemention is used.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Mutual Exclusion</strong>: each resource is either available or assigned to exactly one process.</li>
<li><strong>Hold and Wait</strong>: a process can request resources whilst it holds another resource which it has previously requested.</li>

<h2 id="detection-and-recovery"><a class="header" href="#detection-and-recovery">Detection and Recovery</a></h2>
<p>Detection and Recovery works by building a resource allocation graph and searches for cycles.</p>
<h3 id="detection"><a class="header" href="#detection">Detection</a></h3>
<p>At a high level, the algorithm simply performs depth-first search over each node (resource / process) in the graph. At each node, it checks for any cycles. The algorithm is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>For each node (resource / process) do:</li>
<li>Initialise variable <code>L</code> to the empty list.</li>
<li>Check if the current node exists in <code>L</code> already. If yes then there is a cycle and the algorithm can exit, otherwise continue to 4.</li>
<li>From the current node, check for any unmarked outgoing edge. If there is one, goto 5, otherwise goto 6.</li>
<li>Pick the unmarked edge, mark it so it isn't inspected again, and follow it to the next node. Goto 3 with this node.</li>
<li>If this node is the initial node then no cycles are detected and the algorithm can exit. Otherwise, the search has reached a dead end, so remove it from <code>L</code>, set the previous node to the current node, and goto 3.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recovery"><a class="header" href="#recovery">Recovery</a></h3>
<p>There are three potential techniques for recovering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-emption</strong>: temporarily take resources from the owner process and give it to the waiting process. This only works in certain conditions as if that process is using the resource then giving it to another state might corrupt its state.</li>
<li><strong>Rollback</strong>: processes are temporarily checkpointed (e.g. by making images of their memory and state), and on a deadlock the process is rolled back to the previous state before the deadlock condition.</li>
<li><strong>Killing Processes</strong>: select a random process in cycle and kill it. The safety of this technique depends significantly on the workload of the process (e.g. may be safe for compile jobs, but not for a database system).</li>

<p>Banker's Algorithm is used to check if a sequence of resource allocations will lead to a <strong>safe state</strong> or not.</p>
<p>A <strong>safe state</strong> is any state where there exists a sequence of allocations that guarantees all customers can be satisfied.</p>
<p>Using the example of a bank:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly set-up with a single type of resource.
<ul>
<li>A bank may have N customers, where each customer has maximum credit expressed in a number of credit units (e.g. 1 credit unit = £1000).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each customer may ask for its maximum credit at some point, use it, and then repay it.</li>
<li>The banker knows that all customers don't need their max credit at the same time, so they can reserve less than the sum of all credit limits.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, take the following setup:</p>

<p>A state can be determined to be safe or not by:</p>
<ul>
<li>checking if there are enough resources to satisfy <strong>any</strong> maximum request from some customer.</li>
<li>by assuming that customer pays back their loan, check the next customer closest to the limit, and repeat.</li>
<li>if this results in the state were all loans are paid back (each customer has 0 credit to pay back), then the state is safe.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then consider the following states, one is safe and the other is unsafe:</p>
<pre><code>    SAFE               UNSAFE

<p>The first state is safe as the following sequence of requests can occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>C requests 2 credits (Free: 0).</li>
<li>C pays back 4 credits (Free: 4).</li>
<li>D requests 3 credits (Free: 1).</li>
<li>D pays back 7 credits (Free: 8).</li>
<li>B requests 4 credits (Free: 4).</li>
<li>B pays back 5 credits (Free: 9).</li>
<li>A requests 5 credits (Free: 4).</li>
<li>A pays back 6 credits (Free: 10).</li>
</ol>
<p>With this definition of a safe state, we can then only grant requests that lead to a safe state. This doesn't necessarily mean that an unsafe state will lead to a deadlock, but rather that it cannot be guaranteed that it won't lead to a deadlock.</p>
<p>This algorithm can be generalised to handle multiple resource types.</p>
<h2 id="prevention"><a class="header" href="#prevention">Prevention</a></h2>
<p>Prevention works by preventing any one of the four deadlock conditions: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, or circular wait:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attacking the Mutual Exclusion Condition</strong>: for example, by sharing the resources.</li>
<li><strong>Attacking the Hold and Wait Condition</strong>: force all processes to request their resources before starting, and if they aren't all available then wait. This has an issue that the process must know what resources it will need in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Attacking the No Preemption Condition</strong>: by forcing a process to give up their resource. This can be bad in certain situations, such as a stopping a process using an external output device (e.g. a printer) would be bad.</li>
<li><strong>Attacking the Mutual Exclusion Condition</strong>: either by forcing a process to use a single resource (which would cause optimality issues), or by numbering all resources and forcing processes to request resources in the order they are numbered (this is hard as a large number of resources would be difficult to organise).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-types-of-deadlock"><a class="header" href="#other-types-of-deadlock">Other Types of Deadlock</a></h2>
<h3 id="communication-deadlock"><a class="header" href="#communication-deadlock">Communication Deadlock</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>communication deadlock</strong> is specific type of deadlock caused by a poor communication policy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process A sends a message to process B, but the message is lost in transit.</li>
<li>Process B is blocked whilst it is waiting for this message.</li>
<li>Process A is blocked whilst waiting for a response.</li>
<li>Both processes are blocked waiting for each other, hence it is a deadlock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ordering of resources or careful scheduling are not useful here. Instead, we can use a communication protocol based on timeouts. In the previous example, A and B would timeout and be able to recover fully.</p>
<h3 id="livelock"><a class="header" href="#livelock">Livelock</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>livelock</strong> is when processes are not blocked, but they or the system as a whole is not making any progress.</p>
<p>For example, constider a system which has two processes where one receives messages and the other processes them. If the processing thread has a lower priority then under high load (i.e. when many messages are being received), the processing thread will never be able to run. This situation is also known as a <strong>receive livelock</strong>, and they are related to <strong>starvation</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="starvation"><a class="header" href="#starvation">Starvation</a></h3>
<p>Starvation is the event where progress is not being made as the system is unable to schedule the required process. Picking the correct scheduling policy is important to prevent certain livelocks.</p>

<h1 id="logical-vs-physical-address-space"><a class="header" href="#logical-vs-physical-address-space">Logical vs. Physical Address Space</a></h1>
<p>Memory management binds a <strong>logical</strong> address space to a <strong>physical</strong> address space:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Logical addresses</strong> are generated by the CPU, and are the address space seen by processes.</li>
<li><strong>Physical addresses</strong> refer to the physical system memory, and are seen by the memory unit.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are the <strong>same</strong> in compile-time and load-time address-binding schemes, but are different in the execution-time address-binding scheme.</p>
<h2 id="memory-management-unit-mmu"><a class="header" href="#memory-management-unit-mmu">Memory Management Unit (MMU)</a></h2>
<p>To achieve this binding from logical to physical addresses with an acceptable speed (every address needs to be translated, so it has to be fast), the mapping from logical to physical is implemented in hardware. This allows user processes to deal only with logical addresses.</p>
<p>An example MMU function would be to add a value stored in a relocation register in the MMU to every address passed to it from the CPU before being sent to memory:</p>
<pre><code>                           Relocation
             Logical        Register       Physical
             Address         14000         Address

   +-----+             +---------------+             +--------+
   | CPU | ----------&gt; |      MMU      | ----------&gt; | Memory |
   +-----+     346     +---------------+    14346    +--------+

</code></pre>
<p>Note, the relocation register holds the value of the <strong>smallest physical address</strong> allowed.</p>
<h1 id="allocation-and-protection"><a class="header" href="#allocation-and-protection">Allocation and Protection</a></h1>
<h2 id="contiguous-memory-allocation"><a class="header" href="#contiguous-memory-allocation">Contiguous Memory Allocation</a></h2>
<p>Contiguous memory allocation works by splitting the main memory into two partitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kernel</strong>: held in low memory and with an interupt vector (for the Operating System).</li>
<li><strong>User</strong>: held in high memory (for user processes).</li>
</ul>
<p>User processes would be given contiguous ranges of memory. Then we could give the MMU two registers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Base register</strong>: contains the value of the smallest physical address for a particular range (same as the relocation register as before).</li>
<li><strong>Limit register</strong>: contains the size of the range of addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on which process is running, the MMU changes the value in these registers (dynamically mapping logical addresses).</p>
<p>Thus the base and limit registers define a logical address space:</p>
<pre><code>
       0 +------------------+
         | Operating System |
  256000 +------------------+
         | Process          |
  300040 +------------------+ &lt;-- Base: 300040
         | Process          |
  420940 +------------------+ &lt;-- Limit: 120900 (420940 - 300040)
         | Process          |
  880000 +------------------+
         |                  |
 1024000 +------------------+

</code></pre>
<h2 id="memory-protection"><a class="header" href="#memory-protection">Memory Protection</a></h2>
<p>This scheme allows for the protection of memory accesses such that each process can only access its own memory. This is done by checking that <code>base &lt;= address from CPU &lt; base + limit</code>. If this is true then the access is allowed to continue to memory. Otherwise, the process is trying to access memory that was never allocated to it so the hardware traps to the OS to abort the process (segmentation fault).</p>
<h2 id="multiple-partition-allocation"><a class="header" href="#multiple-partition-allocation">Multiple-Partition Allocation</a></h2>
<p>During the lifetime of multiple processes, <strong>holes</strong> will occur in memory when processes are freed:</p>
<pre><code>
  +------------------+       +------------------+      +------------------+
  | Operating System |       | Operating System |      | Operating System |

</code></pre>
<p>Holes of various sizes exist scattered throughout memory, so when a new process needs to be allocated the memory from a large enough hole is used. In order to do this the OS stores information about the <strong>allocated partions</strong> and <strong>free partitions (holes)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="dynamic-storage-allocation"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-storage-allocation">Dynamic Storage Allocation</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple techniques for satisfying an allocation from a list of free holes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>First-fit</strong>: allocate in the first hole that is large enough.</li>
<li><strong>Best-fit</strong>: allocate in the smallest hole that is large enough. If the list is not sorted by size, this must search the entire list for the best hole, but it produces the smallest leftover hole.</li>
<li><strong>Worst-fit</strong>: allocate in the largest hole. This also requires that the entire list is searched (unless it's sorted), and it produces that largest leftover hole.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that first-fit and best-fit are better than worst-fit in terms of <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>storage utilisation</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="fragmentation"><a class="header" href="#fragmentation">Fragmentation</a></h2>
<p><strong>Fragmentation</strong> is caused by an inefficient use of memory, which can reduce capacity, performance, or both. There are two types of fragmentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>External fragmentation</strong>: when there is enough total free memory to satisfy an allocation request, but it is not contiguous so the rquest cannot be satisfied.</li>
<li><strong>Internal fragmentation</strong>: when a hole may be too small to be used for anything i.e. the allocated memory will always be larger than the capacity of the hole.</li>
</ul>
<p>There isn't much that can be done about internal fragmentation, but external fragmentation can be reduced by <strong>compaction</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="compaction"><a class="header" href="#compaction">Compaction</a></h3>
<p><strong>Compaction</strong> is when the contents of memory is shuffled around to place all the free memory into one large block. Whilst this can help make the memory more efficient, it can lead to I/O bottlenecks.</p>
<h2 id="swapping"><a class="header" href="#swapping">Swapping</a></h2>
<p>The number of process is limit by the physical size of memory. However, many processes may not actually be running, so they are just wasting space. To solve this, they can be <strong>swapped</strong> out of memory to the disk. This frees up memory for new running processes, and they can be brought back into memroy when for continued execution.</p>
<p>This technique requires that swap space is allocated on the disk (either as a file or as a dedicated partition).</p>
<p>The time taken to swap a process in to / out of memory is a major part of the swap time.</p>
