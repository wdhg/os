# Logical vs. Physical Address Space

Memory management binds a **logical** address space to a **physical** address space:

- **Logical addresses** are generated by the CPU, and are the address space seen by processes.
- **Physical addresses** refer to the physical system memory, and are seen by the memory unit.

They are the **same** in compile-time and load-time address-binding schemes, but are different in the execution-time address-binding scheme.

## Memory Management Unit (MMU)

To achieve this binding from logical to physical addresses with an acceptable speed (every address needs to be translated, so it has to be fast), the mapping from logical to physical is implemented in hardware. This allows user processes to deal only with logical addresses.

An example MMU function would be to add a value stored in a relocation register in the MMU to every address passed to it from the CPU before being sent to memory:

```
                           Relocation
             Logical        Register       Physical
             Address         14000         Address

   +-----+             +---------------+             +--------+
   | CPU | ----------> |      MMU      | ----------> | Memory |
   +-----+     346     +---------------+    14346    +--------+

```

Note, the relocation register holds the value of the **smallest physical address** allowed.
